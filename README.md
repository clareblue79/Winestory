#### Inspiration
The WineStory application developed for Multitaction tables aims to enhance the wine-drinking experience, without interrupting the social interaction between the users. We first thought of this idea because the Multitaction table--in addition to its various other functions--is essentially a horizontal tabletop that can be applicable in contexts where a table is necessary, such as drinking and dining. The topic was then narrowed down to wine drinking, as each bottle of wine unfolds stories: a story of the wine itself (from its origin, taste, etc) and an in-depth personal story of the drinkers facilitated by the drinking experience.

The experience of drinking wine can be a challenging one for beginners, with a large amount of information thrown at the drinker by an expert (i.e. wine sommelier, waiter, etc) and this information is often not fully processed. We wanted any level of wine enthusiasts to indulge in the exploration and understanding of the wine they’re drinking in an interactive, collaborative manner by displaying different pieces of information about the wine they’re drinking. Rather than listening to a large chunk of information as soon as they receive the bottle, drinkers can choose to read about a specific aspect of the wine they’d like to know more about. 

The interface is divided into two spaces. The top half is a wine cellar that holds different pieces of information in a bottle. The bottom half of the screen has the look of a velvet-clothed table top to resemble those that one might see at a fancy restaurant or bar. The space is meant to be for users to place their glasses and share their personal story and wine experience as they converse.
